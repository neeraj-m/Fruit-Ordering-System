# Fruit-Ordering-System

## Task
Implement a javascript console order system for fruits.

Available fruits are:
* Bananas
  * Id: 1
  * Name: “Conchita Bananas”
* Red apple
  * Id: 2
  * Name: “Red star apple”
* Green Apple
  * Id: 3
  * Name: “Green diamond”
* Melons
  * Id: 4
  * Name: “Havanna sugar melone”

##User stories (as a user...)
1) ... I can order a specific fruit and tell the system how many pieces I want.
1) ... I can add as many orders as I want.
1) ... I can remove one or more pieces of a single fruit from the order list.
1) ... I can retrieve my *order list* containing all added pieces.


###Acceptance criteria for order list
- For each ordered fruit one line in the console with the name of the fruit and the quantity I have ordered.
- Not ordered fruits are not in the *order list*.
- Only one line per fruit – not one line per order!
