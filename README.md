# Fruit-Ordering-System

## Task
Implement a javascript console order system for fruits.

Available fruits are:
* Bananas
  * Id: 1
  * Name: “Conchita Bananas”
* Red apple
  * Id: 2
  * Name: “Red star apple”
* Green Apple
  * Id: 3
  * Name: “Green diamond”
* Melons
  * Id: 4
  * Name: “Havanna sugar melone”


## As a user...
- [x] I can order a specific fruit and tell the system how many pieces I want.
- [x] I can add as many orders as I want.
- [ ] I can remove one or more pieces of a single fruit from the order list.
- [ ] I can retrieve my *order list* containing all added pieces.


### Acceptance criteria for order list
- [ ] For each ordered fruit, one line in the console with the name of the fruit and the quantity I have ordered.
- [ ] Not ordered fruits are not in the *order list*.
- [ ] Only one line per fruit – not one line per order!


### Left TODO:
- [ ] removeFromOrder() - including check for negative values
- [ ] saveAndPrintOrderList()
- [ ] Code commenting
- [ ] Example usage on index.html
- [ ] A little styling (bootstrap?)
